From an early age, I felt that I had a deep connection with computers,I realised it when I was in my 4th grade, compared to other students in my class I felt operating computers was natural in me. That was the starting point of my life which involved computers. From then I started feeling the hunger for learning more about computers and every time I learn something new about it the passion towards computers started increasing. The passion towards computers and the hunger of learning new things made me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering. I'm studying in University of Strathclyde (Year - 4) where I'm learning much more intresting things about computers which I'm proud about!
