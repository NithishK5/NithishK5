Right from when I can remember, I've felt an intense connection with computers. As a kid, I was fascinated by the mere idea of computers simplifying and completing tasks in just one click. When I was in fourth grade, I could quite easily operate the system compared to my peers. That is when my journey with computers began. Growing up understanding the science behind computers, instilled a profound passion in me to be versed in the study. Since then, I've always had the urge to learn more about computers. The thirst for computers never seemed to be quenched. The more I learn, the more I needed to learn new. This hunger and inquisitiveness pushed me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering. Moreover, realizing the true opportunities that computers provided, I chose computing to be my career. Currently, I'm studying at the University of Strathclyde (year 4) where I'm doing what I always wanted to- mastering computers and many more stimulating things, making myself really proud
